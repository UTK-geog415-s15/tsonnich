Tyler Sonnichsen was born in Boston in 1983, grew up in Connecticut, and has gradually moved farther away (culturally, if not in the Cartesian sense) from New England. He attended Syracuse University, graduating with a B.S. Degree in 2005, moving to Washington, DC largely because he felt like it (and it was possible in 2005). He got bored with being a yuppie and fulfilled his long-held desire to return to Geography at Long Beach State in 2011. He completed his M.A. in Geography in 2013, and moved to Knoxville in August of 2013. He really likes music and hockey, both to an almost obnoxious degree. He currently studies the multidimensionality of the relationship between music and place, especially in regard to public memory, technoculture, and emotional geographies.
